    <h1>How to make Doro wat</h1>
    <p>Doro Wat is Ethiopia’s iconic chicken stew, known for its deep, spicy flavors and rich, aromatic sauce. Slowly simmered 
        with onions, garlic, ginger, and the signature berbere spice blend, this hearty dish is traditionally served with hard-boiled 
        eggs and injera, the Ethiopian sour flatbread. It’s a dish of celebration, often enjoyed at family gatherings, holidays, and 
        special occasions, yet simple enough to prepare at home with patience and love.</p>
    <p>In this recipe, we guide you step-by-step through creating authentic Doro Wat. You’ll learn how to build flavor gradually—starting 
        with the slow-cooked onions, layering in berbere and niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter), and gently braising the chicken until 
        tender. The result is a deeply satisfying, fragrant stew that pairs perfectly with injera or rice.</p>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the chicken
                <ul>
                    <li>Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry. Rub with lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
                    <li>Let sit for 30 minutes while preparing the base.</li>
                </ul> 
            </li>
            <li>Cook down the onions
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the chopped onions in a large heavy pot over medium heat (without oil) and cook 
                        slowly, stirring often, until they soften and reduce in volume (about 20–30 minutes). 
                        This step builds the base flavor.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add fat and aromatics
                <ul>
                    <li>Stir in niter kibbeh (or butter). Add garlic and ginger, cooking for 2–3 minutes until fragrant.</li>   
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Build the sauce
                <ul>
                    <li>Add berbere spice blend and cook gently for 2–3 minutes, stirring to release the flavors.</li>
                    <li>Mix in tomato paste and continue cooking for 5 minutes, stirring often.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Simmer the chicken
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the marinated chicken pieces, turning to coat well in the spiced onion mixture.</li>
                    <li>Pour in chicken stock (or water) and season with the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
                    <li>Cover and simmer gently for 40–50 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and tender.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add the eggs
                <ul>
                    <li>Prick the hard-boiled eggs with a fork (so they absorb flavor) and gently nestle them into the stew.</li>
                    <li>Simmer for another 10 minutes, allowing the eggs to soak in the sauce.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Finish & serve
                <ul>
                    <li>Stir in a spoonful of extra niter kibbeh for richness, if desired.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot with injera or rice, garnished with fresh herbs.</li>
                </ul>
