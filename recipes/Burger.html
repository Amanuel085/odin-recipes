    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the meat sauce
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a large pan over medium heat. Add a drizzle of oil, then sauté the onion until soft (about 5 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the ground beef (and pork if using), breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until browned.</li>
                    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and sugar (if using).</li>
                    <li>Simmer uncovered for 20–30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Add parsley at the end if desired.</li>
                </ul> 
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the cheese filling
                <ul>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, parmesan, salt, pepper, and fresh herbs. Mix until smooth.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cook the noodles (skip if using oven-ready)
                <ul>
                    <li>Boil lasagna noodles in salted water according to package directions until al dente. Drain and lay flat on parchment paper or lightly oiled baking sheets to prevent sticking.</li>   
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven
                <ul>
                    <li>Set oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Assemble the lasagna
                <ul>
                    <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Layer noodles over the sauce (3–4 depending on the size).</li>
                    <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture on top.</li>
                    <li>Add 1/3 of the meat sauce.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle with mozzarella.</li>
                    <li>Repeat layers (noodles → ricotta → sauce → mozzarella) two more times.</li>
                    <li>Finish with noodles, remaining sauce, mozzarella, and parmesan.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Bake
                <ul>
                    <li>Cover with foil (tent it slightly to avoid touching the cheese). Bake for 25 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove foil and bake an additional 20–25 minutes until bubbly and golden.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Rest before serving
                <ul>
                    <li>Let the lasagna cool for at least 10–15 minutes before slicing. This helps it set and makes serving easier.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Garnish & enjoy
                <ul>
                    <li>Sprinkle with fresh basil leaves before serving if desired.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
